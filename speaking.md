# Speaking

The room host should let you know in advance what the requirements are for speaking.

Some sessions will require you to use a shared laptop, others will let you plug in your own equipment.

No one wants to see you fiddling around with resolution settings for 5 minutes. Make sure you have your slides on a USB stick or easily accessible online and be prepared to use the room's laptop.

Some rooms do not have audio from laptops. Check in advance whether you can play sound from your laptop.

Hold the microphone like you are eating an ice-cream. Keep it close to your mouth and speak into it.

Look at the audience, not your slides. No one wants to see the back of your head. Face the audience at all times.
