Languages in Brussels
=====

The conference language is English: all talks will be in English, and almost
everyone you meet on the ULB campus will speak at least some English. If you are a
native English speaker, please be polite! Many people are speaking it as a
second, third, or even 4th language.

Brussels is a multi-lingual city: the ULB is a French-speaking university in a
French-speaking corridor of the city, but the city is in the middle of the
Dutch-speaking region of Belgium. The European parliment is near the city
center: you can likely find people here who speak any of the
[24 official languages of the EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union)!
That said, the majority of the signage, food menus, and announcements in the
city are in Belgian Dutch
("[Flemish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_in_Belgium)"), French, and/or
in English, and the locals usually speak French and some English.

If you don't speak *any* French or Dutch, learning some
[basics](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/French) can help you navigate the city.
