# What to wear

Use layers. The weather can be damp, wet, cold and sometimes almost warm.

The rooms can get quite humid and warm when crowded, but some areas get quite
chilly because the doors are opened frequently.

There is no wardrobe service or place to leave your belongings or extra
jacket. You bring along all your clothes all days, so make sure you have a
backpack large enough to fit whatever you decide not to wear.
