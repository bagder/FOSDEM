# Power

There is a shortage of power outlets. The few that exist will be occupied by
someone else if you even find them.

Bring enough (charged) power banks to allow your devices to last through the
day.

Please do not lay extension cables over the stairs and walkways - these are a trip hazard.

Belgium uses the Type F "Schuko" plug, 220-240 Volts, 50 Hz. Travellers from the UK will need a two-pin adapter. Travellers from other countries may need a transformer if their device doesn't support 220-240V.
