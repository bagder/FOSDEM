# What to eat

There are usually several food trucks at FOSDEM. Food is "festival style"; designed to be eaten on the go and slightly expensive.  Queues for food will be long at lunchtime. Either arrive early or chat to your queue neighbours.

Hanging around the food area is a great way to meet new people and bump into old friends.

## Vegan / Vegetarian

At previous FOSDEMs there was a vegan / vegetarian food truck but, as above, queues will be long at peak times.
